This module aims at answering to a problem asked in a probability & statistics
course from the Polytechnic School of Louvain (LFSAB1105 Probability and 
Statistics, by Donatien Hainaut and Rainer Von Sachs). Whenever we reference a
book, it is the reference book of the course :
Mathematical statistics with applications. Wackerly, Mendenhall, Scheaffer.

This module provides functions to compute some basic quantities over 
arbitrary large samples, (like the mean, the variances, and quantiles), 
to generate pseudo-random numbers following exponential and gamma 
distributions, and many plot and printing utilities.

This module needs Python 3.5+ to run
