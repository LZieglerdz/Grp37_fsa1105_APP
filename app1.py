    """
    Get a matrix of random times, in second, where each entry is the time spent
    at a single workstation. To fit the problem we were asked, the matrix
    should be 5 columns wide, because manufactured screens go through 5
    workstations, and have any number of rows (as many as manufactured
    screens).

    The probability distribution of these random time follows an exponential
    distribution.

    :param size: The size of the matrix. The number of row can be seen as the
        number of screens manufactured, and the number of column as the number
        of workstations to go through before completing the screen assembling.
    :param mean: The mean of the exponential distribution.
    :param manual: Set to true to compute exponential distribution from
        equiprobable random numbers (slower). When set to false, uses the
        numpy function.

    :return: A matrix of random times following exponential distribution.
